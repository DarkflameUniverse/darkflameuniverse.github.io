## Hello Explorers!
			
### The Darkflame Universe Team

With LEGO Universe's official closure in 2012, we and many others felt the game was taken too soon.  
This game was responsible for so many friendships, memories and amazing LEGO builds; so we set out to bring it back.  

In 2013, Darkflame Universe started as a project between Gie Vanommeslaeghe and Neal Spellman, but grew as more developers joined the community.  
What once was a small Skype group of old LU players became a thriving community on Discord, our own forums and Twitter.  
In 2021, we made the tough decision to open-source our server software due to the legal challenges of hosting a public server and the many licenses needed to distribute clients.  

*This was possible because of all of you. Thank you.*  
The community, all developers within the community and past/present from our team, the original game developers who've thrown encouraging words and The LEGO Group for caring about fan projects.

Today, we continue to work with The LEGO Group to secure a good future for LEGO Universe.  
While we have no announcements to share at this time, we hope you'll continue to check in and follow the team for the latest news.
