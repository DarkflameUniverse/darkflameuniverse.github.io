question: DarkflameServer is licensed under AGPL-3.0. What does that mean?
---
Many people came together to make Darkflame happen. These contributors agreed
(and the license requires) that anyone that comes across a copy of the server
emulator should be free to run it to play the game -- as long as you respect that this
freedom is sticky i.e. anyone playing on a server running Darkflame is entitled
to see, review, copy and reuse the full source code of that particular version
from whoever is running the server.
