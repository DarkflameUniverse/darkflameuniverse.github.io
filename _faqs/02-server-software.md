question: Where do I get your server software so I can play with my friends &amp; family?
---
Our server software is available on [our official GitHub, DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer) and the setup process has been vastly improved since our initial release. We recommend [HailStorm32's setup guide](https://gist.github.com/HailStorm32/169df65a47a104199b5cc57d10fa57de) if using a Windows machine. If you still have questions, please utilize [our GitHub's discussion page](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer/discussions/categories/q-a).
