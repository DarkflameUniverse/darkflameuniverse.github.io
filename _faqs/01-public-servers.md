question: I see an advertisement for an official/public server; should I play on this?

There are no "official" LEGO Universe servers. The Darkflame Universe team does not endorse or recommend any servers that are open to the public. We recommend users either host their own server, as we discuss below, or join a private server hosted by friends/family.
