question: How can I report a server or user that is misusing your software?
---
If you find a server or user that is charging money for in-game rewards/any other benefit, disabling moderation/allowing inappropriate content or doing illegal activity, please report this to The LEGO Group using their [Compliance Line](https://www.lego.com/compliance-line). Please include as much information as possible and warn others to stay away from it if you see talk online about it.
